Project: iv4lw_host
Author:  Sean Hill

iv4lw_host is a set of perl scripts that collectively represent host-side tool
for interacting with the iv4lw gadget from a host computer.  Currently, it's
more of a dumping ground for me to track scripts that I don't want to lose, but
have no immediate use for someone besides me.

README: This file
bitfields.pl: Legwork script that takes a list of tube segments and transforms
  them into bitfield defines suitable for inclusion in the iv4lw device code.
  This is handy for creating additional fonts.
iv4lw_host.pl: Host control script for the iv4lw device.  Includes some debug-
  ging handiness for things like calibrating timekeeping goop, but was mostly a
  stepping stone to get to iv4lwd.pl.
iv4lwd.pl: Host control daemon for the iv4lw device.  Starts a server, then
  forks and listens for work to do.  Keeps the device displaying the right time
  and scrolls funny messages.  That kind of thing.
walk.pl: This was the core logic I used to write part of iv4lwd.pl - implements
  a random walk down a tree of words that differ from one another by only one
  letter.  It's entertaining to watch.

Of these, iv4lwd.pl is nominally the most useful.
